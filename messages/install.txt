A minimal Sublime Text theme, based on a single color shared by all interface elements.

If you know what you're doing, .sublime-theme names are
  - HueAccentBlue.sublime-theme
  - HueAccentGreen.sublime-theme
  - HueAccentWater.sublime-theme
  - HueAccentYellow.sublime-theme

Check the README found at https://github.com/Gliptal/Theme-HueAccent/tree/master for further details.
