HueAccent
======

A minimal Sublime Text theme, based on a single color shared by all interfaces elements. The theme is based on the following rules:

- Full white (255,255,255) is used for selected details, such as strings and icons.
- Theme color is used for selected UI elements, such as tabs and rows.
- Grayish is used for non selected details.
- Slightly darker or lighter versions of the theme color are used where needed.

Available colors right now are:

- Blue
- Green
- Water
- Yellow

Check the Bug and Requests section of this README if you'd like more colors added, or feel free to edit my theme and add them yourself (check the Editing section).

Installing
======

1. If you haven't done already, install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
2. Look for "Theme - HueAccent" in the available packages list and install it (CTRL-SHIFT-P > Package Control: Install Package).
3. Edit you Preferences.sublime-settings file (Preferences > Settings - User) adding '"theme": "HueAccentWater.sublime-theme",'.

Editing
======

Editing the theme is fairly simple:

1. Reach "Theme - HueAccent.sublime-package" inside the "/Installed Packages" directory. Inside "/themes" copy one of the .sublime-theme files and rename it.
2. Use Package Control to download and install on your Sublime Text [Package Resource Viewer](https://github.com/skuroda/PackageResourceViewer).
3. Using said plugin, find and edit the .sublime-theme file you previously created.
4. Remember to change your "theme" entry in your preferences to your new .sublime-theme file name.

The "accents" file in the "settings" directory is also a good reference containing the colors used for each version of the theme.
